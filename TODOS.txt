IDE:
- no mouse needed for anything (Switch between tree and file/ switch between files, close files) -> cokeline needed
- copy/paste
- projects to easily get old prject loaded -> over tmuxinator
- default config, which specific can extend and add things (default: no python support, specific for python: has all default things + python support)
- git support (adding, commiting, pushing, also better merge conflict reader like jetbrains does it) -> merge conflict handler
- newline without going into insert mode
- vernÃ¼mftige ""(){}[] setzter mit option  das markiert ist damit zu umklammern, wie jetbrains das macht
- find & replace modus
- see test coverage in IDE
- functions folding


Very Special:
- then cd in a folder with shell.nix -> auto load the file
- shell.nix has the default + specific configs loaded
- starts tmux (or something similar), whith multiply terminals open, where stuff runs already, like viewing looger, testing application, etc.
- load env variables and environments in specific subfolders (python venv only in backend folder for example)


Maybe GIthub group, where I do all this things? Project with configs, project with own nevim plugins if needed
